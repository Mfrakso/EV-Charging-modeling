# EV-Charging-modeling
# EV Charging Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) charging data to optimize charging infrastructure, predict energy demand, and enhance user experience. The insights drawn from the data will help EV charging station providers optimize their operations to meet rising demand efficiently, align with future EV adoption trends, and provide valuable metrics for the optimization process.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze charging session data and develop strategies for optimizing the deployment of EV charging stations. Key objectives include:

- Identifying peak hours and optimizing charging station availability.
- Understanding the impact of vehicle types and battery capacities on charging behavior.
- Predicting user behavior based on charging session frequency and duration.
- Providing actionable insights for EV charging station providers to meet rising demand.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes various metrics from EV charging stations, such as:

- **Energy Consumed (kWh)**
- **Charging Duration (hours)**
- **Charging Cost ($)**
- **Energy vs. Distance Driven**
- **Temperature Data**
- **Charger Types (Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast Charger)**

## Key Insights

- **Peak Hours**: Peak charging times occur during the late afternoon and evening hours. By optimizing station availability during these hours, station providers can reduce wait times and improve user satisfaction.
- **Charging Costs**: Charging costs vary by charger type, with DC Fast Chargers generally incurring higher costs than Level 1 and Level 2 chargers.
- **Charging Duration**: Most charging sessions last under 4 hours, with some sessions exceeding that time.
- **Energy Consumption**: There is a positive correlation between energy consumed and distance driven, but other factors, such as vehicle efficiency, also influence charging behavior.
- **Temperature Impact**: Temperature affects energy consumption, with cold temperatures typically requiring more energy for charging.
